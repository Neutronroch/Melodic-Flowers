        <h1 class="card-tittle">✨ Lotus – The Bloom of Purity ✨</h1>
        <p class="card-sub-tittle">peace and calm</p>
        <p class="card-info">The lotus, rising pure from muddy waters, symbolizes purity, rebirth, and spiritual awakening. <br>Revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, and many cultures, it reflects beauty, resilience, and the journey toward enlightenment.</p>
        <p class="symbolize">🌸 What It Symbolizes When You Gift a Lotus <br>

Purity of heart and intentions 💖<br>

Blessings of peace, prosperity, and spiritual growth ✨<br>

Encouragement to stay strong in tough times 🌿<br>

Respect and honor 🙏<br>

Hope for renewal and enlightenment 🌞<br>

👉 Unlike roses (which are personal and romantic), the lotus is a sacred and uplifting gift—it conveys purity, good wishes, and respect more than romantic love.

Would you like me to also create a short gift-meaning line (like “When you gift a lotus, you are wishing…”) that you can directly use under a “Gifting Meaning” section on your website?</p>
